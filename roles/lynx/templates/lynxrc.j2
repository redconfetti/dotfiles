# user_mode specifies the users level of knowledge with Lynx.  The
# default is "NOVICE" which displays two extra lines of help at the
# bottom of the screen to aid the user in learning the basic Lynx
# commands.  Set user_mode to "INTERMEDIATE" to turn off the extra info.
# Use "ADVANCED" to see the URL of the currently selected link at the
# bottom of the screen.

# If verbose_images is "on", lynx will print the name of the image
# source file in place of [INLINE], [LINK] or [IMAGE]
# See also VERBOSE_IMAGES in lynx.cfg

# If vi_keys is set to "on", then the normal VI movement keys:
#   j = down    k = up
#   h = left    l = right
# will be enabled.  These keys are only lower case.
# Capital 'H', 'J' and 'K will still activate help, jump shortcuts,
# and the keymap display, respectively.
